      IM on Procurement does not mandate the need for 3 quotes.</br></br> However,
      assessment of the reasonableness of the price(s) quoted is still required.
      Assessment may be based on verbal or written quotes, recent purchases, suppliers'

  utter_faq/FAQ-awarding proposal with highest score for Price-Quality Evaluation:
  - text: >
      Quotations/Tenders should only be awarded to the tenderer who obtains the
      highest score, and deviation should only be exercised if there are overriding
      considerations outside of the stated evaluation criteria (e.g. firm is facing
      litigation case which may be of relevance to the quotation/tender). Otherwise,
      we should recommend award to the tenderer with the highest score, so as to
      avoid accusation of favouritism and perception of bias."
  utter_faq/FAQ-signing formal contract or agreement:
  - text: >
      IM on Procurement does not mandate the signing of Formal Contract or
      Agreement after the Letter of Acceptance or LOA is issued to the successful
      tenderer. However, a Formal Contract or an Agreement is necessary when the
      procurement is complex or when the nature/scope of the works involved warrants
      it. This is to ensure that both parties have the same understanding on the
      documents that form the contract to prevent downstream disputes. Examples
      where a Formal Contract or an Agreement may be required:\1.High value complex
      projects (e.g. construction projects, consultancy projects, etc) 2. Many rounds
      of tender clarifications during evaluation 3. Goods/services to be delivered
      over a period of time (e.g. system development, term contracts, etc 4. Many
      items in Schedule of Rates 5. Many milestones/ deliverables involved

  utter_faq/FAQ-rules for giving honorarium:
  - text: >
        An honorarium is a payment for a service which has been done ex gratia
        or which fees are not legally required. Since the payment is made
        without the giver recognising any liability or legal obligation (i.e.
        there is no contract between URA and the receiver), this is not
        considered procurement and would not be subject to the IM on Procurement
        rules and procedures.
  utter_faq/FAQ-rules for giving honorarium_1:
  - text: >
        The honorarium amount could be a token sum as a form of appreciation, or
        an amount to cover the necessary expenditure (e.g. hotel, air tickets)
        incurred by the speaker. While there are no guidelines on the IM with
        regard to the amount, individual agencies shall ensure there are
        adequate internal controls in place to approve the amount.
  utter_faq/FAQ-rules for giving honorarium_2:
  - text: >
        Please note that if URA choose to procure the speaker’s necessary
        accommodation and air tickets, procurement rules will apply for the
        procurement of the accommodation and air tickets.
  utter_faq/FAQ-approval process honorarium:
  - text: >
        All of the following conditions are to be met for honorarium:a) The
        party is providing the services out of goodwill (e.g. no
        fees/charges/favours requested) b) There is no intent to form a
        contractual relationship c) There will not be any agreement which will
        bind both parties legally d) The honorarium given is not agreed upon
        upfront
  utter_faq/FAQ-approval process honorarium_1:
  - text: >
        Please put up an expenditure paper for the honorarium (which will
        require Fin's support) and address these conditions in your paper to
        provide proper justification for giving honorarium, including the
        quantum.
        
  utter_faq/FAQ-considerations for proc of G+S:
  - text: >
        Besides adherence to the 3 key principles, staff should also demonstrate
        socio-political sensitivity to public expectation on the usage of public
        funds, i.e. (i) we should not procure lavish, extravagant, or
        unnecessary products or services and indulge in wastage (ii) we should be
        mindful of the public’s perception of our purchases, e.g. paying a
        premium for a goods vis-à-vis a lower cost one which could also meet our
        requirements
        
  utter_faq/FAQ-factors for proc of high-end G+S:
  - text: >
        When the procurement is for niche or high-end products or services, the
        public could presumably misconstrued them as luxury and therefore you
        should exercise more caution and consider to:(i) re-examine the need
        for such products or services especially if the buy is a common product
        or service, e.g. chairs, booking of venue for conference, transport
        service, etc.; (ii) Search for alternatives, i.e. similar products or
        services which are more mid-range or alternative work solutions which
        can deliver similar outcome; (iii) In the event that (i) and (ii) cannot
        be fulfilled, you should prepare a cogent explanation for the
        procurement in anticipation of any queries from the public.
  utter_faq/FAQ-Conflict of Interest:
  - text: >
        The guiding principle is that an officer's private interests should be
        separate from his public duties, and that there should be no conflict of
        interest between an officer's official position and his work, and his
        activities outside his official duties. When in doubt at any procurement
        stage, officers should declare any potential conflict of interest and
        inform their supervisors.
  utter_faq/FAQ-using RFP and not tenders:
  - text: >
        A Request for Proposal (RFP) is a procurement approach to communicate
        outcome-based requirements and where the proposal that most closely fits
        the needs and budget is selected, or where it is not industry practice
        to tender for the items.
  - text: >
        While RFP allows for diversity in proposals submitted and for discussion
        and changes in scope, you must note that evaluation of proposals will be
        more challenging as you are not comparing like-for-like.  So for the
        straight forward buys, where requirements are standard and there is no
        need for innovation, tender is still the best method to employ.
  - text: The same principles and procedure for calling tenders also apply to RFP.
  
  
  utter_faq/FAQ-is purchase (SVP) if below $6000:
  - text: >
        You need to check if there are any existing bulk tenders (e.g. in place
        before starting on procurement. This applies to all types and value of
        procurement, including SVP. SVPs are meant for low value one-off
        purchases that are not available from Demand Aggregation contracts (e.g.
        DSTA or IDA Bulk Tender). Departments should exercise prudence and ensure
        that their expenditure on small value buys are reasonable.
  utter_faq/FAQ-splitting purchase:
  - text: >
        Generally, purchases should not be split into small quantities in order
        to avoid complying with the instructions under IM on Procurement. Where
        needs can be reasonably foreseen, you should plan purchases in advance
        and aggregate those of similar nature so as to benefit from economies of
        scale. If there is a recurring need for the purchase, departments should
        look into establishing a period contract.
  utter_faq/FAQ-A14:
  - text: >
        First, you should decide on the most appropriate approach-whether to
        “in-source” (engage another Government Agency) or “outsource”, based on
        factors such as efficiency and best value. If the decision is to
        ‘out-source’, the procurement rules would apply. In this instance, you
        shall not approach the Government Agency to participate in the
        tender/quotation as they should not be competing with private sector. If
        the decision is to “in-source”, it is considered as collaboration
        between Government Agencies which is not subject to procurement rules.
  utter_faq/FAQ-A16:
  - text: >
        Weightage for evaluation criteria should also be stated upfront in the
        tender documents so that all tenderers are aware what is important to us
        and bid on a level playing field.
  utter_faq/FAQ-A15:
  - text: >
        EPPU and BCA registrations do give indication on the financial capacity
        of the tenderers. No further financial evaluation will be required if
        that is adequate for your assessment. However, you are still free to
        request for further financial information if deemed necessary according
        to your risk threshold level for the particular tender.
  utter_faq/FAQ-Specify budget in tender docs:
  - text: >
        IM is silent on whether you should specify the budget in your tender
        documents. There are pros and cons in doing so. Specifying a budget may
        cause suppliers to quote around your budget even though they are able to
        supply/deliver at a much better value. Not specifying the budget may
        attract a whole spectrum of bids, some or all of which are way beyond
        your budget. You will have to assess this while preparing your
        specifications.
  'utter_faq/FAQ-proc with EPV below $70,000':
  - text: >
        Yes, a tender can also be used as a sourcing method for procurement with
        EPV below $70,000. The Quotation Approving Authority shall be the
        approving authority for Approved Procurement Value (APV) up to $80,000
        in reference to IM on Procurement, Stage 4, FAQ 1.1.
  utter_faq/FAQ-choosing between Direct Contracting and Limited Tender or Quotation:
  - text: >
        Differences between these 2 approaches are summarised in the table. You
        will have to assess which approach is more appropriate for your
        purchase. Refer to Stage 2-Determining Procurement Approach for
        details on how to seek approval for Limited Quotation or Tender or Direct
        Contracting.
  utter_faq/FAQ-need min. opening period for tenderers invited to bid:
  - text: >
        No, there is no minimum opening period for limited quotations or tenders
        but it is a good practice to provide at least 3 working days so that
        tenderers have sufficient time to prepare their tender submission.
        Please note that if the invited tenderers are not able to respond by the
        closing date, you would have to re-call the tender.
  utter_faq/FAQ-Limited Tender for sensitive proc:
  - text: >
        Unless the procurement qualifies for Limited Tender, open tender must be
        called. “Sensitive in nature” is not one such ground for Limited Tender.
        You need to pay extra attention to tender documents and to ensure that
        they are desensitised for public consumption. If the tender details are
        sensitive, you may consider not to publish the entire tender document in
        GeBIZ. Tenderers who are interested will need to collect the relevant
        tender documents containing the sensitive information from our premises.
        You may also consider asking tenderers to complete a “Non-Disclosure
        Agreement (NDA)” form before releasing the tender documents.
  utter_faq/FAQ-proc procedure for cash vouchers:
  - text: >
        Procurement principles apply to purchase of vouchers. Even though
        vouchers have a face value, they are not necessarily sold at face value.
        It is possible that merchants may sell these vouchers below face value
        at bulk volume discounts, or sell at face value but include non-price
        perks such as additional free vouchers or longer validity periods etc.
        Hence it is useful to compare these non-price elements as well.
  utter_faq/FAQ-changes allowed to tender in 2-stage tendering:
  - text: >
        Generally, revisions made to the original tender (be it terms and
        conditions or requirements) should be fine-tuning in nature and should
        not be substantial such that it warrants a new tender to be called. It
        is not possible to have a guideline like changes should be limited to x%
        of the original tender. So you ought to state the scope of changes when
        seeking approval from CEO/DCEO before carrying out 2-Stage tendering.
  utter_faq/FAQ-single bid for open quotation or tender:
  - text: >
        You may award the single bid if you have:(i) Assessed that the proposal
        fully meets your requirements (ii) Assessed that the price submitted by
        the single bidder is reasonable (e.g. you may compare with past
        purchases, market rate etc) (iii) Ensured that the Specifications are
        not overly prescriptive such that they preclude competition (iv) Allowed
        sufficient time for suppliers to submit their bids (especially for
        complex tenders)  (v) Made effort to cultivate interest and encourage
        suppliers to participate in the quotation/tender after it has been
        published.  MND has mandated that clearance from CEO / DCEO is required
        to accept the single bid prior to award.
  utter_faq/FAQ-more than 1 bid received but only 1 acceptable:
  - text: >
        No, a single-bid situation is when only one bid is received in the
        quotation or tender. In the event your quotation/tender has two line
        items-one of the items only receives one bid while the other receives
        more than 1 bid, this is also not considered as a single bid.
  utter_faq/FAQ-evaluation for late hardcopy tender submission:
  - text: >
        Whether the hardcopy submission is late, you have to ensure that the
        acceptance of late hard copy submission does not give rise to unfair
        practices.  </br></br> You should consider whether the information
        submitted via the hardcopy submission affects the prices or the proposal
        submitted via GeBIZ. If the hardcopy submissions are merely supporting
        documents which contain factual information (e.g. financial statements),
        there should not be any concerns as tenderers are not able to modify the
        late submission to their advantage (e.g. to further refine their
        proposal with the additional time or after having knowledge of the bids
        published on GeBIZ).  </br></br> The best way to avoid such situation is
        to mandate a full electronic submission whenever possible.
  utter_faq/FAQ-steps to take when recalling a tender:
  - text: >
        You could consider:</br> (a) revising specifications to ensure they are
        broad enough to attract competition;</br> (b) lengthening the opening
        period of the tender or quotation; and/or</br> (c) alerting suppliers to
        the opportunity published on GeBIZ.
  'utter_faq/FAQ-in Tender Evaluation Committee (TEC), have friend in bidding company':
  - text: >
        You should flag out any conflict of interest or possible public
        perception of conflict of interest when submitting the tender evaluation
        and recommendation reports to Tenders Board for approval. This could
        include cases where related parties including ex-URA staff (who may be
        involved directly or indirectly in the formulation and preparation of
        the tenders/quotations earlier) are part of the bidding parties. If in
        doubt, you should flag out potential conflict of interests for Tenders
        Board information.   The same would apply for tenders to be submitted to
        MND’s Tenders Board for approval.
  utter_faq/FAQ-approval for qualification of selective tenders:
  - text: >
        Selective tender is a procedure where only suppliers satisfying the
        conditions for participation ("qualified suppliers") can submit a
        tender. It comprises 2 stages – Pre-tender Qualification stage and the
        Tender cum Qualification stage. Refer to <a target='_blank'

  utter_faq/FAQ-Purchase Order for tender proc if already have Letter of Acceptance:
  - text: >
        Technically, only one type of contracting instrument is required for
        each procurement. However, if it is a period contract with downstream
        purchases, then a PO needs to be raised for such downstream purchases.
        The initial Letter of Acceptance was only to formalise the standing
        arrangement of the period contract at the upstream.
  utter_faq/Purchase Orders(PO) to note:
  - text: >
        The 2 most commonly used POs are:</br> a) e-Catalogue PO (e-cat PO)</br>
        b) Direct PO (DPO)</br></br>  E-Cat PO is PO generated as a result of
        period contracts which are formed via a quotation or tender. This should
        be used when you are raising a PO from an existing period contract, e.g.
        DSTA bulk tender for catering, URA term contract for printing.
        </br></br> DPO is a standalone PO which is not linked to any
        quotations/tenders. DPO should only be used for ad-hoc purchases which
        are not tied to any contracts or small value purchases not above $6,000,
        where necessary. You may refer to the Finance Circular Minute M20/2003

  utter_faq/FAQ-assessing additional works:
  - text: >
        Judgement is required in assessing whether the works constitute
        variations to the contract, or whether a new quotation/tender should be
        considered for the additional works. </br></br> Generally, new
        quotations/tenders should be considered if:</br> a) Scope of new works
        is outside the original scope of works of the contract.</br> b) Contract
        period is extended for too long.</br> c) Additional works are extensive
        or are of high value, as this may mean that the works are attractive
        enough for new suppliers to consider putting in bids. </br> d) Works are
        substantial and go beyond the Approved Procurement Value, as this may
        indicate that the original assumptions upon which the project was based
        are no longer valid.
  utter_faq/FAQ-contract variation involves an increase in APV:
  - text: >
        The new Estimated Procurement Value (EPV) is the estimated cost of the
        goods and services to be procured (e.g. estimated unit price x estimated
        quantity), including contingency amount, provisional sum and contract
        options, if any. See IM Procurement Stage 2, Rule 7.3 for details on how

  utter_faq/FAQ-novation request from existing contractor:
  - text: >
        Novation is often the result of changed circumstances midway through the
        contract e.g. mergers and acquisitions, financial difficulties, sale of
        a part of the business or inability to fulfil contractual obligations.
        If the existing contractor is unable to carry on with the works
        satisfactorily, you may consider novation.  </br></br> You should:</br>
        (i)     Assess the novation request and whether the new contractor is
        capable of undertaking the remaining services or supply of goods without
        any change in contractual terms.</br> (ii)    Put up a recommendation
        report to the original QAA/Tenders Board which approved the term
        contract to proceed with the novation if the new contractor is assessed
        to be suitable. </br> (iii)   Clear the “Novation Agreement” with Legal
        dept. The Novation Agreement shall be signed by 3 parties i.e. URA, the
        existing contractor and the new contractor. </br></br>  If the new
        contractor is not capable of undertaking the works, you may decide not
        to effect the novation and to terminate the contract according to the
        contract terms and conditions, and call a new tender to carry out the
        remaining services or supply of goods.
  utter_faq/FAQ-novation required for new company name in existing contract:
  - text: >
        The required action to be taken depends on what is meant by the “change
        in company name”, and whether the legal personality of the company has
        changed after the change in name. For example, if a person has changed
        his name, he is still the same person, and there is no change in the
        legal personality. Similarly, for a company that has changed its name
        but everything else about the company is retained and unchanged, there
        is no need for novation. A simple contract variation to account for the
        change in name will suffice in this case.</br></br> However, in some
        instances where company names are changed to signify a change in
        management or even the entire organisation, for example in cases of
        merger and acquisition, novation is necessary in order to transfer all
        legal liabilities of the existing contract to the new legal personality.
  utter_faq/FAQ-debarment:
  - text: >
        No. Debarment is serious and cuts off Government procurement
        opportunities for errant contractor. Hence, the IM only provides for
        debarment of higher value purchases procured via tender.

        shortened after the Quotation Notice has been published or issued so
        that suppliers are not caught unaware of the change in opening period

        Regardless of how urgent your needs are, you can only start work after
        Quotation Approving Authority (QAA) / Tender Approving Authority (TAA

  utter_faq/FAQ-collecting Security Deposits:
  - text: >
        Security Deposit (SD) is a safeguard in tender to ensure that the
        supplier delivers his supplies or perform his services promptly in
        accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract.  </br></br>
        For contracts with EPV equal to or below $500,000:SD shall be
        waived.</br></br> For contracts with EPV exceeding $500,000:Line
        department shall assess the risks of procurement and determine if there
        is a need to collect SD. Refer to <a target='_blank'
        href='https://intranet.mof.gov.sg/portal/IM/Themes/Procurement/Stage-3-Specifying-Requirements/Topics/SECURITY-DEPOSIT.aspx'>IM
        on Procurement, Rule 6 on Security Deposit </a> for details. </br></br>
        The following are examples of where SD can be waived:</br>  (a) where
        the goods, services and construction services are provided by another
        GPE i.e. a ministry, government department, organs of state or a
        statutory board.</br></br>  (b) when the tender is for those
        professional services controlled by recognised bodies for example, the
        Singapore Medical Council, Singapore Dental Board, Board of Architects,
        Professional Engineers Board, Accounting and Corporate Regulatory
        Authority, Land Surveyors Board and Law Society of Singapore;</br></br> 
        (c) where payment is made only after satisfactory delivery of goods and
        services, and/or where the risk and consequences of default are assessed
        to be negligible or acceptable to the GPE;</br></br>  (d) when there is
        cost-saving by waiving the security deposit, and the risk is
        manageable.</br></br>  (e) For consultancy services in construction
        projects, GPEs should in general not impose any security deposits on
        consultants listed under the Public Sector Panel of Consultants (PSPC)
        for all disciplines, including quantity surveying and project management
        services.  This is because consultants' performance is often centred on
        their professional competency. As most consultants would have taken up
        Professional Indemnity (PI) insurance for professional negligence, the
        PI coverage would usually suffice. This would also align our practice to
        the industry norm. </br></br>
  utter_faq/FAQ-changing Conditions of Contract (COC):
  - text: >
        The COC are cleared by AGC, where there is a list of optional clauses
        which can be included or excluded, depending on the requirements. If
        there are other changes to the COC, please clear with Legal.
  utter_faq/FAQ-guidelines on the cap for limiting liabilities:
  - text: >
        The default position should be to remain silent on the capping of
        liabilities. Remaining silent on the capping of damages and liabilities
        does not mean that the vendor bears unlimited risks. Leaving it silent
        just means that in the event of damages or liabilities, the amount that
        the vendor is liable for will be determined by the courts, depending on
        legal precedents and what is reasonable.</br></br>  If the line
        department assesses that it is necessary to set a cap on the
        liabilities, this has to be done after carefully analyzing the risks for
        that procurement. The effect of such a limitation clause is that the
        Government will be underwriting some of the contractor’s liability. In
        view that the risks involved for each procurement differs, it is not
        possible to set any “norms”.  Line department would also have to specify
        the limit based on the nature and value of the tender as well as the
        risks to URA in the event of a breach.  It is advisable that no dollar
        figure be quoted but a percentage of the contract value be stated as the
        limit to the contactor’s liabilities in the contract.
  utter_faq/FAQ-disqualification for bids higher than EPV:
  - text: >
        You should not automatically disqualify tenderers on the sole basis that
        bids exceeded EPV. Please continue to assess based on the evaluation
        criteria stated upfront. If the recommended bid is higher than EPV, you
        can seek approval to increase the EPV.
  utter_faq/FAQ-considered procurement if collab with other govt agencies:
  - text: >
        When GPEs collaborate with other GPEs, there is no intent of parties to
        form legal relations with each other. So procurement rules do not apply.
        GPEs can consider using email exchanges, notes/minutes of meeting or
        non-legalistic Memorandum of Understanding between GPEs to list down the
        roles, responsibilities, funding/manpower commitments and scope of the
        collaboration where necessary.
  utter_faq/FAQ-minimum quotation opening period applicable to Request for Quotation:
  - text: >
        No, the minimum quotation opening period is not applicable to RFQ.
        Nonetheless, the time given to the suppliers to respond to the RFQ must
        be of a reasonable period. If there is a minimum opening period
        specified in the framework agreement, please adhere to the contracted
        RFQ opening period. You should contact the contract administrator for
        clarifications on such contract terms.

  - text: >
        In this instance you can specify a lower financial category for each of
        the tenderers since your intent is to award to a panel of suppliers. You
        can consider using the average contract value based on an estimated
        panel size to gauge a suitable financial category.
  utter_faq/FAQ-minimum number of suppliers to alert when publishing quotation or tender:
  - text: >
        No, there is no minimum number of suppliers you need to alert. You
        should try to tap on the widest possible supplier base and alert as many
        as practicable.
  utter_faq/FAQ-other platforms to conduct procurement:
  - text: >
        No, GeBIZ remains the only platform for all government procurement to be
        performed, although we can use other platforms to further publicise the
        procurement opportunities.
  utter_faq/FAQ-A52:
  - text: >
        The purpose of alerting suppliers is to bring to attention a procurement
        opportunity which has already been published openly. You should try to
        alert as many suppliers as practicable after the invitation to
        quotation/tender has been published on GeBIZ. This is to avoid being
        seen as biased towards the notified suppliers.  While doing so, please
        ensure that the notified suppliers do not receive additional information
        on top of those already published in the quotation/tender in order to
        ensure fairness and transparency.

  utter_faq/FAQ-non GPA or FTA-covered tenders minimum tendering period:
  - text: >
        Procurement which is not covered under GPA or FTA need not comply with the
        obligations in the international agreements, hence a minimum of 14 days
        is permitted. You must still give sufficient time for tenderers to
        submit a response to the tender.
  utter_faq/FAQ-bringing forward tender closing date with all tenderers submitting their proposals:
  - text: >
        No, you cannot do so.  This is because any of the x tenderers is
        entitled to submit a fresh proposal which replaces or overwrites the
        earlier one, as long as he does so before the tender closing date and
        time.
  utter_faq/FAQ-waiving liquidated damages (LDs):
  - text: >
        For consultancy services in construction projects, the department
        should, in general, not impose LDs on consultants listed under the
        Public Sector Panel of Consultants (PSPC) for all disciplines, including
        quantity surveying and project management services.  This is because
        consultants are typically engaged ahead of the construction phase and
        usually with some float time available. Consultants' performance also
        depends on when and how the department engages them. It is often not
        possible to ascertain if project delays can be specifically attributed
        to the consultants for construction projects.   Additionally, it is also
        the industry norm not to impose LDs on construction consultancy tenders.
  utter_faq/FAQ-deciding if qualified bids should be allowed:
  - text: >
        You should consider the type of goods/services they are procuring and
        the nature of the industry. For example, when purchasing
        commercial-off-the-shelf items where evaluation is fairly
        straightforward and usually based solely on price, and where it is
        expected that there could be numerous tenderers, allowing for qualified
        bids may not be necessary. However, where the nature of the purchase is
        complex and it is expected that our standard terms and conditions may
        not fully address certain industry terms and conditions, allowing for
        qualified bids can be considered. </br></br> If there are any
        requirements or clauses which are deemed essential, it should be made
        clear in the quotation/tender documents that these are mandatory and not
        to be varied by the tenderer. Proposals which vary such essential
        requirements should then be deemed as invalid and excluded from further
        evaluation. Examples of requirements or clauses which may be considered
        as essential could include tender validity, applicable law, IP ownership
        etc.
  utter_faq/FAQ-differentiating tenderers with different qualification degrees or aspects of the Tender:
  - text: >
        If qualified bids are allowed, you should make clear in the evaluation
        criteria how variations made by the Tenderer will be evaluated and how
        it will take into account any additional risk or cost to URA as a result
        of the qualifications.  For example, it must be made clear to tenderers
        that proposals with variations to the Conditions of Contracts may be
        scored lower compared to proposals that are fully compliant, and those
        with qualifications that give rise to substantial impact to URA would be
        scored lower than those that do not. </br></br> Tenderers can also be
        instructed to explicitly provide additional cost, for full compliance to
        the Tender clauses so you are able to make a better assessment of the
        trade-offs.
  utter_faq/FAQ-invoking of Limited Tender during extreme urgency:
  - text: >
        Extreme urgency refers to situations or events that are beyond the
        reasonable contemplation of agencies or which occur suddenly, and the
        timing of the intended procurement has impact to the proper functioning
        of the Government. Some examples include unexpected situations which has
        impact on public health, public safety, national or homeland security;
        Or disruptions of on-going contracts due to unexpected default by
        contractors. However, this ground should not be used loosely, for
        example, to justify internal deadlines due to a lack of planning or
        delays by the department in calling the procurements.
  utter_faq/FAQ-request tenderers to extend their offer validity more than once:
  - text: >
        The IM on Procurement does not stipulate a cap on the number of
        extensions. Nevertheless, departments should request for further
        extensions only if they have reasonable grounds to do so, as tenderers
        are under no obligation to agree to their request for extension of
        tender/quotation validity period beyond what the departments have
        specified for in the ITQ/ITT, as these are commercial decisions.
  utter_faq/FAQ-bid amendment:
  - text: >
        In the event that any errors (including omissions) are discovered during
        evaluation and after the quotation/tender has closed, the erroneous bid
        may be corrected with the approval of the Approving Officer (Bid
        Amendment). Departments have to assess that the following conditions are
        met before a bid amendment can be considered:</br> a) It is a genuine
        error; and</br> b) It does not give rise to discriminatory or unfair
        practices.</br></br>  In assessing whether there is a genuine error,
        Departments can consider if there are supporting indications that
        suggest that there is likely to be a genuine error. </br></br> Also,
        please note that omitted factual documents can be accepted via
        clarifications and approval for bid amendment is not necessary. Refer to
        flowchart below to determine if approval for bid amendment is required
        and the appropriate Approving Officer (Bid Amendment)
  utter_faq/FAQ-level of approval for bid amendment:

        alterations</br></br>  b) DCEO</br> For non-pricing alterations (e.g. to
        accept non-factual documents that were omitted in the proposal for
        further evaluation)</br></br>  c) Dir (Finance)</br> For pricing
        alterations due to genuine errors that can be verified against the
        supporting documents (e.g. typo errors, calculation errors)
  utter_faq/FAQ-using bid amendment to correct bid error:
  - text: >
        The following must be met before a bid amendment could be
        considered:</br> a) It is a genuine error; and</br> b) It does not give
        rise to discriminatory or unfair practices.</br></br>  Whether the bid
        amendment affects a tenderer’s compliance with any criterion, even if it
        is a critical criterion, is immaterial.
  utter_faq/FAQ-tenderer doesn't provide evidence to support error was genuine:
  - text: >
        If the department cannot ascertain that there is a genuine error or
        assessed that the bid amendment should not be carried out, there is no
        need to consider doing bid amendments.</br></br>  In such cases, the
        department may evaluate the proposal based on the tenderer’s original
        bid.
  utter_faq/FAQ-A66:
  - text: >
        Approval from AO(Bid Amendment) is not required to rectify the nominal
        bid price on GeBIZ as there is no actual amendment made to the bid
        price. However, Departments must highlight the details of the correction
        in the quotation/tender report. Finance will correct the nominal bid
        price on GeBIZ.</br></br>  If there are price discrepancies between a
        tenderer’s price on GeBIZ and their attached documents, and there are
        doubts on which is the correct bid price, Departments should seek
        clarification from the tenderer.</br></br>  Departments can try to
        minimise the occurrence of tenderers placing nominal bid prices on GeBIZ
        by having clear instructions in the ITQ/ITT and reducing the number of
        line items on GeBIZ, where feasible.
  utter_faq/FAQ-A67:
  - text: >
        Departments may accept the clarifications provided that it does not give
        rise to unfair practices (e.g. preferential treatment given only to
        selected tenderers). Approval from AO (Bid Amendment) is not required.
        However, the withdrawal of qualification will still need to be
        highlighted in the quotation/tender report.</br></br>  The intent of
        having a single set of COC/requirements for the quotation/tender is to
        ensure that tenderers could compete fairly on a level playing field. If
        the tenderer agrees to withdraw the qualifications after clarification,
        it brings their bid back to a level playing field which is in compliance
        with the COC/requirements.
  utter_faq/FAQ-bid amendment required to correct error of tenderer not meeting all requirements:
  - text: >
        Approval for bid amendment is not required. However, Departments will
        still need to seek clarification with the tenderer on why they had
        indicated non-compliance to ensure that the tenderers had submitted
        their bid proposals with an accurate understanding of the requirements
        in the ITQ/ITT. The details of the clarification are to be included in
        the quotation/tender report.
  utter_faq/FAQ-difference between 2-Stage tendering and negotiations:
  - text: >
        In 2-Stage tendering, there is no negotiation involved.  The revisions
        to the tender specifications or terms are initiated by the department.
        Essentially the department decides on what to be revised and all
        eligible tenderers are required to submit their new bids which have to
        comply fully with the revised tender.
  utter_faq/FAQ-unauthorized officer signs contract:
  - text: >
        In law, only officers authorized under the Government Contract are
        authorized to bind the Government to legal agreements.  A person who
        purports to bind the Government to a legal transaction which he is not
        authorized to do would be personally liable to the other contracting
        party for any liability arising out of that agreement.
  utter_faq/FAQ-date of award taken as date of establishing contract:
  - text: >
        The Award Notice is published for the public’s information. URA still
        needs to communicate the award to the successful supplier(s) via a
        contracting instrument. It is only reasonable that the successful
        supplier(s) know the result of the award before or, at the very least,
        the same time as the public. The date of tender/quotation authority’s
        approval is internal within URA and is usually before the contracting
        instrument is given to the successful supplier(s). So, publishing the
        Award Notice 3 days from tender/quotation approval date would
        potentially be informing the award decision to the public before the
        successful supplier(s).
  utter_faq/FAQ-case for debarment when terminating contract:
  - text: >
        If it is the department who wants to terminate the contract and the
        contractor has not defaulted in its contractual performance, then there
        is no need to put up the case for debarment.
  utter_faq/FAQ-terminating a contract:

        For termination according to specific terms in contract, please seek
        CEO’s approval.</br> For reasons other than the violating of the

  utter_faq/FAQ-contractor submit own quotes for star rate works:
  - text: >
        The guiding principle when receiving quotations for star rate works,
        besides getting value for money (VfM), is to ensure that there is no
        conflict of interest when the contractor carrying out the works also
        submits his own quotes. The contractor can call 3 quotes if he does not
        participate in the quotation. However, if the contractor decides to
        participate in the quotation, the consultant shall assist URA to obtain
        3 separate quotes and ensure that the star rate item is valued at fair
        market rate.
  utter_faq/FAQ-guidelines for proprietary products:
  - text: >
        For proprietary products, it is acceptable to use a star rate based on
        sole supplier’s invoice/quotation. Generally, only quotations which are
        reasonable and reflective of market prices should be considered.
        Quotations which are extreme in value should not be considered. The
        consultants shall exercise discretion and professional judgement to
        sieve out quotations deemed not reflective of market prices. </br></br>
        Proper records shall be kept on the above and forwarded to the
        contracting agency for retention and reference.
  utter_faq/FAQ-A74:
  - text: >
        There is no fixed quantum on what constitutes the bulk or substantial
        percentage of works done using star rates. The departments will have to
        exercise their judgement, taking into consideration if it is in the best
        interest to carry out the works as star rate items. Some factors to
        consider include if there are project-specific factors (e.g. site
        limitations may not allow another contractor to work concurrently) and
        if the government is getting value for money in going for star rates.
  utter_faq/FAQ-key principles of Government Procurement:

        procurement objectives, criteria and procedures to suppliers</br> (c)
        Value for Money (VFM)-Procure from suppliers who can best meet

  utter_faq/FAQ-star rate items:
  - text: >
        It is typical in some contracts, such as term contracts for facilities
        management, additions and alterations works or construction contracts,
        for the contract to be structured based on a Schedule of Rates (SOR).
        The SOR lists the unit prices of items needed for the works. As and when
        works are required, the cost of the works is extracted from and built up
        according to the unit prices listed in the SOR.  However, certain items
        may not be listed in the contract’s SOR. These are typically known as
        “star rate” items.
  utter_faq/FAQ-late hardcopy tender submission:
  - text: >
        Whether the hardcopy submission is late, you have to ensure that the
        acceptance of late hard copy submission does not give rise to unfair
        practices.  </br></br> You should consider whether the information
        submitted via the hardcopy submission affects the prices or the proposal
        submitted via GeBIZ. If the hardcopy submissions are merely supporting
        documents which contain factual information (e.g. financial statements),
        there should not be any concerns as tenderers are not able to modify the
        late submission to their advantage (e.g. to further refine their
        proposal with the additional time or after having knowledge of the bids
        published on GeBIZ).  </br></br> The best way to avoid such situation is
        to mandate a full electronic submission whenever possible.
